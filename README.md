# Survival-model-for-patients-with-Primary-Biliary-Cirrhosis

Developing risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. Using a dataset with survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc).

PBC is a progressive disease of the liver caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver.

Our goal will be to understand the effects of different factors on the survival times of the patients. 

We will be using the following two methods for our models:

~ Cox Proportional Hazards

~Random Survival Forests
